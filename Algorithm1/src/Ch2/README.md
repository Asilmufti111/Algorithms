Consider the problem of counting, in a given text, the number of substrings that start with an A and end with a B. (For example, there are four such substrings in CABAAXBYA.)

(a) Design a ``` brute-force algorithm ``` for this problem and determine its eﬃciency class.

(b) Design a more eﬃcient algorithm for this problem [Gin04].
