You have an array of **n** numbers and a number **s**. Find out whether the array contains two elements whose sum is **s**.
(For example, for the array 5, 9, 1, 3 and **s** = 6  the answer is yes, but for the same array and **s** = 7  the answer is no.) 
Design an algorithm for this problem with a better than quadratic time eﬃciency.
